Welcome to the Wavetable Synth \n
 for the Nintendo DS!\n\n

You're probably wondering how to\n
 operate this application, but\n
 wonder no longer! I'm forcing\n
 you, yes YOU, to take part in\n
 a magnificent tutorial!\n\n

Press the right shoulder button\n
 to continue. . .
===============================
This is a table editor! In this\n
 application you will navigate \n
 through various editors that \n
 you can use to control the \n
 sound in several ways.\n\n

Try drawing on the touch screen\n\n

To cycle through editor screens\n
 use shoulder buttons. Use the \n
 right shoulder button to \n
 continue. . .
===============================
There are four main ways to \n
 make sound with this app:\n
 1. Pressing X to play a\n
    testing tone\n
 2. Using the Easy Piano Option\n
    Pak\n
 3. Exporting an sfz file to\n
    use with other music\n
    software\n\n

Use the d-pad to change the\n
 root note of the app. Vertical\n
 directions for octave and \n
 horizontal for semitone.\n\n

Press the right shoulder button\n
 to continue. . .
==============================
If you use the Konami Code\n
 while in a synth mode that\n
 supports sfz exporting, then\n
 sfz exporting will begin.\n
 Consult the README for file\n
 setup.\n\n

Use the select button to cycle\n
 through synth modes and exit\n
 this tutorial. . .
===============================
Wavetable One\n\n

A wavetable synthesizer works\n
 by taking one period of a wave\n
 and looping through it at\n
 various frequencies.\n\n

Use the table editor below to\n
 draw one period of a wave.
===============================
Transition Shape\n\n

This table editor isn't used to\n
 draw a wave. Instead, it is\n
 used to define how wave 1 will\n
 transition to wave 2 over time.\n\n

Fully up means only the first\n
 wave will play. Fully down\n
 means only the second wave\n
 play. Halfway means a wave\n
 halfway between both waves\n
 play.
===============================
This slider determines how long\n
 it takes to go through the\n
 transition shape.
===============================
What does halfway between two\n
 waves mean anyway?\n\n

In my opinion, I see two main\n
 ways of interpreting this:\n
 1. morph: an average of both\n
    waves\n
 2. swipe: the first half of\n
    wave 1 tacked onto the\n
    second half of wave 2\n
===============================
In forward mode, when the right\n
 of the transition shape is\n
 reached, it stays at the right\n
In loop mode, when the right is\n
 reached, it loops back to the\n
 left of the transition shape\n
In ping-pong mode, when the\n
 right is reached, it starts\n
 going backwards to the left,\n
 then back to the right, ad\n
 infinitum.
