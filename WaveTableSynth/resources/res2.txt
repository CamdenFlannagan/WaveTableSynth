Addiction sucks. If you feel trapped and hopeless, I would suggest reading a great book called "The Freedom Model for Addictions." There is a free, abridged version of the book that has personally been extremely helpful. Look it up. It's great. When I read it, it made my situation make sense and not seem hopeless.
