-------------------------------------
Installation:

Extract the contents of "WaveTableSynth.zip". It has everything you need

Make sure that the file "WaveTableSynth.nds" and the folder "sfz" are on the same level
of your drive

There's probably nothing interesting in the "resources" folder ;)

-------------------------------------
Controls:

X - Play testing tone
Easy Piano Option Pak - Play the synth with a range from the root note to an octave above it.
D-Pad Vertical - Move root note up and down by octaves
D-Pad Horizontal - Move root note up and down by semitones
L/R - Cycle through editors for various parameters
Select - Cycle through synth modes
Konami Code - Export an sfz file in synth modes where exporting sfz is available. (The Konami Code is up, up, down, down, left, right, A, B, start.)

Notes for SFZ Export:
- The sfz file and wav files will be stored in the folder "sfz"
- The sfz file will be named "export.sfz". You can use your computer's file manager to rename "export.sfz"
- New sfz exports overwrite old ones. To save your sfz files, copy all of the contents of the "sfz" folder into another folder.
- For more info on sfz files, visit https://sfzformat.com/
- If you have 20-25MB of free space on your flashcart, you shouldn't have to worry about running out of space during the export
